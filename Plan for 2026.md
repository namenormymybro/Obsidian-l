What I want to focus on 
1. School 
2. Fiver 
3. Blockchain analysis 
4. Finishing the finance course
5. Philosophy 

This is a lot to even take into account the magnitude of what I want to do but let's start 
1. School: I can't cheat my way out of this I must stay in the GP range of 2:1
2. Fiver: This is my skill plus money making engine, where I make my money and get gigs
3. Blockchain analysis: This is my skill range for crypto not only about crypto it builds my analytics engine 
   Python, pandas,numpy, matplotlib, plotly 
   This is analysis, this is data analysis helps build the skill and also could help me get Money by working for and with daos, posting on Twitter consistently, analysis of testnets 
   Over time it becomes easier due to the fact that you may have reusable code for whatever you want to do already, which is why In 2026 you need systems not only do systems help reduce your time spent and all that, that help give more intent to other things 
4. The finance course ends on January, do it, finish it, move on with your life don't, make sure you have the best capstone project, this is good because it helps with your long term finance career and also
