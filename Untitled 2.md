'“I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.” — Henry David Thoreau, Walden

This quote from Walden does picture the grand idea of transcendentalism in the sense of deliberate living, know why you want to do something, and don't do things solely because of society programming and pressures and all that

The same core central idea in the book dead poets society, the same core concepts of transcendentalism, that life is to be savoured 

But,
- what exactly is the savoring of life 
- what are the boundaries between savory and extreme or any part of self sabotage as for anything in life it all comes with trade off
- what exactly is savoring 
- the difference between the meaning of life and the purpose of life

Well to start, the meaning of life isn't the purpose of it
Meaning of life dives into certain writers like Nietzsche, and other existentialist minds and thinkers in the sense of 
- Why are we here 
- Why were we born
- what is the meaning of life
- How do we make sense of why we are even alive 
- how to find something to live for so deep that you can fight a bear and that would also pull you through the darkest of times
Nonetheless purpose is
- For what do I want to do with my life 
- For what as Aristotle said in nepotamian ethics - what makes the good life
The former tries to search for why we are alive, why not just die, why live, what is a reason so strong that we live with it
But there's no meaning in life as this can be said by Albert Camus and no one better suited to write on this for it is through him I draw my conclusions if at all, and that is where the meaning of life comes to
What will you do with your life 
How would you consciously choose 
How will you live 


But the biggest purpose of life and doing anything In life is you, and that is why the most important question is what kind of person am I becoming 
To ponder yourself on the meaning of life is to never live 
Somethings do not have meaning but are the meaning in itself 

- -
To live deliberately is not more about pros and cons but about deliberate living, 
The fact that most traders lose makes us ask why trade
Most businesses lose makes us ask why do a business at all
In short there is no pro that is larger than the con but we choose to make the decision 
This is not to ignore all pros nor cons but to deliberately choose what we dive into, you could fail, you could never win but it is in the fact that we take the leap that determines anything at all

This level of clarity must to thought and achieved at your own conclusion, not an Instagram reel can save you, not an advice, but on deep experience and deep thought, for in everything you do in life, in every asymmetric bet or opportunity ponder the pros and cons and ponder whether you can deal with it this is living this is living, I said asymmetric bets, not on what you will eat in the morning, whether you would ask that girl, out send the money or so but on asymmetric bets, the life determining on, the life changing ones, not to ponder on everything, that is too much thought given to a life you only live once 
But then what do we use to determine those decisions, your gut feelings if something is bad it probably is, if you feel it is good it probably is, build your vales, and everything falls into place, somethings do not have a big much effect, do not ponder on this too much, just focus on the big,
It's always the big things we shouldn't fuck up and the small things we should cherish.

But, at what point do you call it quits, that deliberate living is not what you should do


Some self- awareness 
Why do I self sabotage 
Why do I not do things I know I should do
Why do I not have a structure in my life 
Why do I not fight for what I want 
Why do I mold into 
I do overthinking people's reactions a lot
I do take the phrase of living as a form of self sabotage 
I don't know how to go for something for long without doubting, I always get back and I always know when to cut things short but under more wait I don't do anything at all
