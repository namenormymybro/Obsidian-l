Tomorrow is school the end of the fresher chapter into yr 2 and so nothing to grab hold of, then I'm ahead of a yr then I feel like there's nothing holding me back again no safe fresher spot again to fall back on that this is in turn life and having to act and he so confident that I shouldn't show any side of fear at all and nothing should be showing I'm just so….. discombobulated 
Now if you show all the fear in the world would that still make you not enough?
Would that still change who you really are?
Would that be something devastating that you couldn't live without for the rest of your life?
Do you really think you'd fight this wat and win1
