One thing I feel that is required in the lives of everyone is that person that would go the extra mile especially that person that wants to achieve certain things, one thing I I feel someone should have is that person that let's them know what they are capable of and truly tells them what it will take and what it will cost and creates an emotional depth around them and lets them know that even if you go for that goal and you lose everything, I won't condemn you for it and would know that you gave it your very very very best and know that it is not your fault and stop the self attack and the self inflicting behavior and let's you know stay at rest for some while and let you go again
