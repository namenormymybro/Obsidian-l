Things I really want to care about are not many let me write this down as I'm in one of my most rational states of mind 
1. Philosophy(Existentialism, psychoanalysis and any branch of philosophy that I feel are applicable and I'm not saying this in the form of self help kind of way in which men don't read fiction anymore I must squeeze out every bit of productivity because no I am not my fucking kakis but yes doesn't mean I won't read self help to do something if I want to write a thesis or build a brand because let's say the truth why are we so addicted to the hustle culture blah blah blah it’s not that you shouldn't hustle have a Lambo, fame all that that's not the point if you want that go for it I think it’s not about killing desire it's about what you desire why you desire. Like what Julien Blanc said to that person that said but I want to achieve all this he said go for it, don't attach self worth to it don't restrict self love.             At the core, doing something in life boils down to two intertwined forces:

2. The drive to grow — to explore, create, expand, experience more.


3. The need to love yourself through it — to not lose your center while you chase.



If you understand that balance, you’ve basically unlocked the foundation of a healthy, fulfilling life.

But what makes life rich is the way you dance between them.

⚖️ 2. The Two Paths People Usually Take

Path 1 — Achievement-Centered Life

You’re driven by goals, status, and success.

You feel worthy when you achieve.

When you stop winning, you crash internally.


This path creates external success but inner fragility.
You live like you’re always “proving” yourself to someone — maybe to society, maybe to your past, maybe to your own self-criticism.


---

Path 2 — Acceptance-Centered Life

You stop chasing external validation.

You find peace in the present.

But sometimes, you lose the fire — you settle into comfort.


This path gives inner peace but can lack evolution if you stop challenging yourself.

The Real Answer Is the Third Way:

**Growth without self-rejection.**
**Ambition with self-acceptanc**e.

2.  Second of all stop consuming information that I don't really need all to full my ego that I'm learning or that I am smart that is not a way to live, information is not something to be good at 
3. My hobbies should be done not be learnt or be studied or watched, what should make me happy are those I know that I am happy when I watch a Linux video or Linux rice or see someone code something cool and That is alright but I need to act my hobbies not just learn or see or study them if I at least do let me at least the minimum I can do is try them out or write about it and I should I really should get into writing and if I have something I like I cannot try out I try to test it or write about it at least not consuming a lot of things on that thing I cannot do, leave it to another time watching videos doesn't make you a doer watching programming videos doesn't make you a programmer neither is thinking about it or checking for information about it, or talking about it writing it won't but it's the least you could do at least do something connected to it. What this means is simply do more and when you want to watch something based on something it is not doing that thing it is just entertainment at least if you aren't preparing to gather information to do it and entertainment is not bad in itself but doing more makes you feel alive more and have a lot more things to talk about if you fall back in the trap just know how you hate girls that only watch TikTok all day and are boring to talk to
4. Ambition and what I want to do with my life this is the main thing of my life what I learn, how I make money, make an impact, build a brand and all these but these are not just the totality of me I know why I emphasize on this because I don't want to accept myself and not become what I want to be and be complacent and feel shit or guilty but also don't want to get all these and lose myself. 
      Which is this:
      Finance, preferably something like asset management that has to do with macro economics and all but I don't know how this looks like yet 
      Crypto 
      Build an x following and a personal brand even if it's like a persona brand
      Writing books later in life
 And I didn't do certain things like this because anytime I started I was like is this really for me is this my calling, my purpose my mission and the myth of Sisyphus really explained a lot of that for me that just choose your rock and push it and don't wait for something like mission or calling or anything like that to be honest or to numb yourself down by suicide or anything superficial that makes a meaning out of pushing your boulder to numb the pain it gives just something that you want and makes you feel alive or for the money it is not about if it's for the money or not it's why for the money if it's survival and All it's ok if it's for to be Rich Lambo s and all it's okay if it's because all these will attach to your self worth or are From a place of anxiety or fear or so that girls will let you know that you're good sucking your dick and that emotional and ego high it is bad

As isagi said any ego high is bad and detrimental to you and performance 
 5.  Relationships
 6. Social media is not real life do not judge life based on social media, it is an amplifier shows you what you want to see that and only that and it makes you glued to the screen 
 7. Don't romanticize your suffering 
 8. 

This is not a self help guide in which do do do do do, I know how much I hate that and how disgusting it is, and if you just want you something because you want to do it go for it just know
1. Where this is coming from(The why)
2. Don't attach your self worth to it 
3. Don't hold back self love in the process 
4. Try to act something out
