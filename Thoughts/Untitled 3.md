1. Core Philosophy You’re Articulating

At the heart of your writing is a pursuit of balance between growth and self-acceptance, which is very Jungian in spirit but also resonates with existentialist ideas (Camus, Kierkegaard). Let’s break it down:

Two forces in life:

1. Drive to grow – your ambition, creativity, desire to explore, experience, and make an impact.


2. Need to love yourself through it – to maintain a center, avoid attaching self-worth to results, and not let achievements or failure define you.



What most people do:

Path 1: Achievement-Centered – external validation-driven, success-focused, can lead to burnout or existential fragility.

Path 2: Acceptance-Centered – inner peace, self-contentment-focused, may lose fire, become complacent.


Your third way (the insight you want to live by):

> Growth without self-rejection. Ambition with self-acceptance.



This is essentially existential mastery: you choose your “rock” like Sisyphus and push it with awareness and joy, not despair or fear.

2. Observations on Knowledge and Consumption

You’re noticing a very important distinction:

Information ≠ Wisdom or Life.

Consuming knowledge just to feel smart or boost ego is wasted energy.

Learning should have a direct purpose, either to build skills, create, or live better, not to stroke identity.


This is very much aligned with Stoic and existentialist practice—focus only on what actively contributes to your life and chosen path.

3. Hobbies and Flow

You hit another key point: hobbies are to act, not just consume.

Watching Linux videos, coding tutorials, etc., should lead to doing.

Minimal action is enough: try things out, write about them, or implement.

Learning for its own sake (without action) is disconnected from living.


This is a classic existentialist insight: meaning comes from doing, not accumulating knowledge.

4. Ambition vs Self

You are deeply aware of the tension:

Ambition drives you toward finance, crypto, building a brand, writing books.

But you want to avoid letting success define you, or pursuing things from ego, fear, or external validation.


Your writing shows you understand: It’s not whether your goals are “for the money” or “for purpose”—it’s why you want them.

Wanting Lambo, fame, crypto wealth is fine if you don’t tie your worth to it.

The danger is chasing external highs that reinforce ego or fear rather than actual self-expression.

5. Existentialist Practice You’re Adopting

Your reflections echo Albert Camus’s “The Myth of Sisyphus”:

You choose your rock. Push it. The value is in the struggle itself, not in waiting for a preordained “purpose.”

Avoid using external meaning, numbness, or consumption as a substitute for authentic life.


Also, you’re resonating with Jungian integration:

Observing ego vs true self.

Accepting shadow (fear of failure, desire for validation).

Acting consciously, without letting unconscious drives dominate.

6. Practical Takeaways from Your Reflection

7. Philosophy – use existentialism, psychoanalysis, and applicable branches to reflect, not escape. Don’t read philosophy to boost ego, read it to live more consciously.


8. Ambition – pursue finance, crypto, brand-building, and writing, but always check your motivation: is it fear, ego, or genuine curiosity/joy?


9. Hobbies – act, don’t just consume. Even small steps count.


10. Knowledge Consumption – minimal and purposeful. Only what moves you forward or enriches life meaningfully.


11. Balance – maintain the duality: grow and achieve without self-rejection, love yourself without stagnating.






If I were to summarize your “life philosophy” in one sentence:

> Choose your rock, push it with awareness, act intentionally, grow without losing yourself, and love yourself through every step.
