For Albert Camus, the intrinsic goals you create (like personal ambition or skill mastery) are not just acceptable; they are a necessary form of revolt against the universe's silence. The key is in the attitude you hold toward those goals.

🎭 The Absurdist's Approach to Goals and Achievement
The ultimate goal for an absurdist is not the achievement itself, but the act of living fully, passionately, and consciously in the face of meaninglessness.

1. Intrinsic Goals as a Measure of Life
In The Myth of Sisyphus, Camus argues that since life has no ultimate, external meaning, our value comes from the quantity and quality of our experiences, not their final result (Result 2.1).

Wanting to be good at something (Mastery/Excellence): This is a perfect example of an intrinsic goal. The act of becoming skilled—like an artist creating or an athlete training—is a way of "exhausting the possible" (a phrase Camus uses). The value lies in the struggle and the lucidity (clear-headed awareness) you bring to your work. Sisyphus's struggle up the mountain is enough to "fill a man's heart"—not because the rock stays at the top, but because he chooses to be conscious and defiant during the work (Result 2.1).

Ambition/Success: Ambition is embraced as long as it's not based on the delusion that success will bring ultimate, eternal meaning. You can strive to change the world, succeed in business, or master a craft, but you must maintain the awareness that the universe remains indifferent to your success (Result 2.4). The success is for this life only, which is precisely what makes it valuable.

2. Money as a Means, Not an End 💸
Camus, often critical of the societal obsession with material wealth, would view money or excessive consumerism as a potential form of "philosophical suicide."

The Trap of Abstraction: If you make money itself the ultimate goal, you are chasing an abstraction—a stand-in for a real goal—which keeps you chained to a life devoid of genuine freedom and passion (Result 2.6). You live under the illusion that "if only I had the money, I might really have lived" (Result 2.6).

Money as a Tool: If money is viewed purely as a tool to maximize your freedom, experience, and ability to revolt (e.g., funding a creative project or helping others), it is acceptable. The goal must be to live fully now, not to save for a future that is uncertain or a distant "ultimate" purpose.

**Intrinsic goals are not just acceptable; they are the arena in which you enact your revolt, while money or external rewards are tools to enhance your freedom and engagement, not substitutes for meaning.**

**Do not wait for the world to be kinder. Do not wait for life to give you meaning. Live fully now. Face the struggle, choose your path, and make your actions yours. That is the only ‘better’ you can rely on.**

I think from the Albert Camus point of view it is one thing when it cones to the revolt we expect life to be easy we want life to be easy so when it's not easy it feels bad for us because it is the opposite of the internal script we have given life, if only we had just lived not expecting life to be easy or hard just to life and hope even though Camus talked about the hope of suicide that we shouldn't hope that life would get better, everything will have meaning and all but it's still okay to have a bit and of hope that something you want will work out and also just being okay if it doesn't that it's just life anyway and I think that's the greatest mindset in life
