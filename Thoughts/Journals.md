Just by reading this romance anime and all (blue box) and it made me realize and all how much it is good to actually go into a relationship not for going into a relationship sake but for actually loving and wanting to be with that person. I think the best relationships and the type of relationships that are the best is that when the two people in the relationship are good alone but just want to be with together, and give all their love and you just know when you make a woman interested in and actually want to commit to the growth of the relationship, and building the relationship and all rather one of the parties giving all of them because at that point you are not two people in a relationship, you are two people building a relationship and that is the best thing I think that can ever be. Then two of them believe that they were lucky to get each other, because they were very all good alone because I think that if one of them is craving and crazy for validation that that moment you are the best person that is giving her the best quality of validation and all, it is also about yes you might be giving her validation and all but if that is what she leaves on, then that is the bad part of it because you're not the only one that can give you the best validation and all and I think that is the mindset I think I want to bring into relationship:
1. **Be very good and comfortable on your own
2. Make it not about that she has to be in a relationship but to build that entity called the relationship**
