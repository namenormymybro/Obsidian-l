I think we all are spectacular, I think there's something fundamentally different about we all as humans and I'm saying this in the matter of romance and women and I feel I got it wrong all the time by displacing my priorities and thinking that the one who treats her wrong, the bad boy eventually gets the girl I think the reason why is the he doesn't care not in the sense of not caring at All I think it's because of the attributes of that firstly he is after his own thing and knows what he wants, secondly he doesn't allow her skeptics and her antics to emotionally affect him as emotionally attached to her as he may be he is emotionally unattached to her at the same time, so then he seems like someone she cannot pin down because he doesn't live for her he lives for himself, I dare to take that further and say that I would also like to connect with people and really show the kind of person I really am or I really want to be at certain moments of my life, but I think that certain parts of myself doesn't want to because I think that the brain chooses to suffer and quoting Carl Jung here it is a fundamental truth o the psyche not the brain itself and then when you want something positive the psyche compensates by affirming the negative and it happens in so many subtle ways that we don't even know, we are like puppets being played and controlled by our self, we do things for different reasons but we do not know why we do certain things 
What motivates us, what is happiness to us, what we really want, how we really want it, what part of our thinking is limited, who we really are, who we really choose to be and I personally think that makes the free man, the man that can not only understand certain parts of himself but choose him because quoting a certain book 
There exists the last of human freedom and that is choice, the freedom to choose, who we are, what we believe in, what we want, what we choose to want, who we like, who we choose to like, and everything and that is giving all which we have we don't really have that freedom.
Thinking about technology if I ever post this on substack, someone in Germany who I may never see in my life can see this, there by we choose what to see and In a way the person who sees what we want the world to see but in a way choice and the freedom there of is an illusion.
Forgive my unprecedented and unsolicited ranting, and most especially my choice of words because I am not Nietzsche neither am I Fyodor Dostoevsky because I am not a learned scholar, but a student in a third world country, trying to become mainstream and I love to romanticize, I love love, I love romance and just picturing how it is, how the mundane feels good, you just want to be in every moment with them, you picture every moment with them, you glance everytime to steal a look…. Because you are stealing it means they don't need to know, how it pushes you to be a better person, how it pushes you to be good, to be better and just incredible and I thought how can a kid from a third world country get this kind of thing, because getting money and eventually moving to fulfiling countries and travelling the world as romanticized as it is, requires money and then the process of having money is hard, stressful and soulless and for that reason could i do one of two things: I either abandon certain parts of myself and embrace the soulless parts of myself, the Shadow and all because I am not one person but many persons in the body of one or the second thing is to romanticize rolling up my stone like Sisyphus did, the edges of the song, how big it is the vastness the act that I need to give all my power to roll up the stone and in turn I get stronger and makes rolling up my stone easier and how everything just combines, look I can see the horizon, let's admire it, that was nice back to rolling up my stone, and how beautiful it is. 
Hopefully it is the second one I want I get but I life we don't always get what we want, neither what we deserve because in the manga blue lock I read, the ace of the basketball team, chiantsu senpai came Early and practiced and practiced until she eventually couldn't stand most days and didn't win the trophy in the end, and I think the trophy is so hyped, I Don't want to do all that because of some piece of metal though valuable, in the grand scheme useless or didn't capture even a bit of what I did, and I think the real trophy is the one i didn't even see to hold, nor do anyone even remember, because the real trophy is me, who I was after coming out of the fire, the memories, what dies with me, what I am, what I became and that is the real trophy the one I cherish deep within my heart

And I think that you can't understand a sport if you don't play it, the subtle art of playing it, breathing it, the idea that a loss means death in which you can give it your all, I think you cannot understand that if you don't play a sport, the sport or have given your all to something and made that your meaning in general. I think most girls don't do that that's why they cant really understand sports in general, and I that's why they're empty and not worth sharing visions with but I need to be careful about this sense of speech because it may ruin me because as empty as they're that may actually have a meaning that I don't know yet, but I will be on the lookout to understand constantly.
I think that we all as humans we have holes to fill, wink* wink*.
But I do think that we as humans do have holes to fill, wink wink*, I think that I should stop, probably should. That is why we turn to religion in order to explain the absurd, to give life meaning and that our miserable existence has a deep spiritual meaning than it actually does, to make it so that our suffering has a deep meaning that God willingly wishes to be so or choose not to intervene unless called that makes him both a deistic, and a deterministic God at the same time, the make our suffering pass by easier, to make us grounded and keep us humble.
God is not a lie, God is real even if he is not i think that the advantage of religion has not lost it's place, i think religion is the best thing man has created for that reason, though yes religion maybe a form of suicide, philosophical suicide that it gives us some meaning without us having to create our own, I think it's the best thing man has created, I truly do think so. Sorry Albert Camus, you're taking the L on this one 

What is the cause of my ranting, forgive my ranting? Is what I would say if I cared but I think this is the most unhinged part of myself but I choose not to lie in the four corners of a house and rant only on the internet or only to myself or a trusted friend tho I should do that, I want to let the most unhinged parts of myself out and that is not only in this essay or upcoming ones but also in person, I want to stop fear to be a controller of my life, I want to do what I think and yes what I think maybe rubbish, and I still need a filter in my life, everyone does, but I think the best thing for me is to reduce that filter and that is what I really want to do.

I think that In total what I want to accomplish is one thing and that one thing is me, in that one this is many things quite narcissistic yes I agree but I list:
1. Knowing who i really am in romance, what type of person do I like, what type of person do I choose to be in romance and what type of person do I want to be to that type of person and what I would sacrifice for that person 
2. Who am I
3. Who do I choose to be at certain areas of my life can I just be one person or multiple people in of itself in one body. Have to dive into the works of frank Kafka I presume 
4. How can I romanticize the process. As Socrate said love makes us mad and I choose to romanticize what I want to be mad for it, not only do I accomplish what I want, I became who I want, and I have the fun and the memories after or during and be mad, I mean full tilt bozo
5. Showing who I really am after I know who I am, reducing filters 

Because I think that life is unpredictable, it may be cruel, unexpected and all but I think romanticizing life is one way I can enjoy it, get what I want, and die a happy man 

After this i want to research it was because of soul searching I am able to write this in the first place and because of soul searching I will continue to do so, so for me it begins and ends with soul searching that and choice 

But left to my own devices who am I, who really am I, what do I want, what is this self, what do I hope to do, what do I hope to accomplish, what is my meaning in the face of the absurd 




Well I've written so much, so much that I can't even read not because it's hard to read this much volume of text in and off itself it's because I gave out my heart to it so it seems weird reading it and I can't help but think about how I try to fit into other people's mirrors and I break my own or I cover mine up and dress up in order to fit into other people's mirrors, how I hold myself back subconsciously from being in the moment and being my most unhinged self all that stems from childhood, then I could just say this is the type of person I am, I need to embrace it and then find a partner who would love me for this but I think as humans we can be anything it's all conditioning, the reason why I think I like something because I was conditioned to and I hate something else because I was conditioned to like and live the opposite so I hate the opposite of that and I would say that fundamentally I can change as a human being, fundamentally change as a human being and maybe embraceshadow then I thought what is my shadow, who is my shadow and how can I dine with the devil
