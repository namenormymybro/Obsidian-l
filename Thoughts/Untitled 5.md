In our thirst to avoid failure like a plague we never win
This then brings to show how far is too far how can you be willing to go too far but then accept that if you don't get it it's still life, it's still you 
For what do you do these things for 

And I'd say for the love of it, you only live once, not in an irrational way that you blow up everything, live under a bridge, make merry with your booze and make it a life, for what is a life worth living if at some point never faced two extremes in life
We both love it soo much and do it and both indifferent for that is a life worth living 
Everyone's definition is different for if yours isn't you are a conformist with no appeal to think on your own and make life your foothold ‘cause at some point money is not something to hold you from living life but one to help you live it, 

For why love if you will get your heart broken 
Why go to battle just do die 
For countless men have lost their lives
And more so will continue to plunder each other 
And fall deeply and foresake the law of the scrolls which therefore state
‘‘Thou shall not kill’
But what is a life in which you don't go for it
What is a life in which you don go the extra mile 
As long as you still have the best people beside you, you and the necessities I'd day everything else is secondary 

You are not going to die from getting your heart broken 
Nor from losing a chunk of your money
Irrationality is not a synonym for living life
You can enjoy life and still be serious 
Have morals and still laugh at them 
For the irrational person is a fool more so the laid back for life requires one or more
