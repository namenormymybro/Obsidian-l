Self help changes nothing, real change is inspired by a lot more than that it's deeper not to say from a psychological point of view 

Remember when I was watching Vinland Saga and Thors told him, you have no enemies and Thorfin never understood because he hadn't passed through it enough, arguably if he understood he wouldn't have harbored deep resentment to Askeldad all over the years hated him to the extent became a slave to him, only reward was a duel he never one because Askeldad was one character 
Thorfin went from being one of a child to that of an empty strong adult he wasn't a character by my living definition but Askeldad was one

Who is a character?
- someone smart 
- Someone introspective 
- Someone goal oriented 
- Someone that has something to fight for
- knows people not by volume but by liquidity, by definition by definition 
- Knows how to get what he wants that is a character 

So what brings about real change 
I'd argue it's emotional change, imagine if nothing ever happened to you. You lived life knew things, got married, fucked, died you may not change because life didn't demand you to
In short life happens to you, and you become that or one of two things you fall into despair or you prevail though not a concious action if the seeds are not planted foreso
And also identity change we all have a goal or should have and that's the biggest one yet,

what kind of person am I becoming?

This is the most important, most creative question and the answer is too, and then the best answers are the longest net positive ones not one of only money, life accomplishment but of purpose, one of Choice, one if experience, This is but the grandest things one can do

But know something you are a net positive 
An action a day doesn't define the kind of person you are becoming but the sum of all concious actions and efforts each day


If there is one thing to internalize it is
What type of person am I becoming, and making a concious choice each day to be that

The question who am I becoming is not to be used as who do I want to be become because you will in someway never be who you want to be if that's the best way to explain
