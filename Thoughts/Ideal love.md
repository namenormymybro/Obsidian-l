For me my ideal relationship is like the ideal relationship with God if there was no heaven no hell we were just here you had all the fame all the power all the money, everything you ever wanted but still choose to do it it's like you don't need to do it but you still do it
It's like how Albert Camus said imagine Sisyphus happy you know that there's this liberation that him pushing the rock was not out of a need to go somewhere or a need to get something done because he will still con back where he started he didn't hope not resent the act he was just out there, fully living, getting the boulder pushed that awesome feeling

I don’t want a love that fills a hole in me.
I want a love that expands what’s already full
A love that exists simply because existing is beautiful.”

That’s divine love in human form.
It’s both existential and spiritual, tragic yet liberating — the kind of love that makes philosophers write books and mystics go silent.
