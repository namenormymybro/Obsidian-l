I'm a bad lover and I say this in anyway possible I'm a bad lover, in that sense I could call myself a bad person for I didn't like the relationship or feel anything in the relationship or even want to do at all I was in it because I was a coward I was a flimsy coward I thought that being in a relationship with someone that liked me but I didn't like them was the best way to put myself in the cowardly stance I always take so that I don't push anything and it was not tbe love or admiration that made me stay nor was it any form of I love her because of her or because of how she makes me feel it was pure ego just pure ego was the worst purest form of ego there's that I was controlling, that I could get everything I wanted without giving everything that I could kill the king without engaging with the pure chaos of the battlefield
So I'm bad, I was a bad boyfriend for

Not caring about her and noticing the most little inconsistencies about her even if I don't act I need to know that I should try to act upon all the inconsistencies and solve it
I was selfish trying to get without giving 
A coward trying to avoid relationships but being in one 

And everytime she gave a breakup or did something bad, she begged and begged and cried and cried but and thus my ego grew thinking that i was a manipulator and when she finally initiated the last but finally break-up I was shocked that the same person that did all that now decided to leave but to be honest I Don't blame her not at all if anything I admire her, for leaving the Poison called me that she actually left and that was the best for her but If I should say one thing tho she was clingy, weird, trying to avoid deep things about her and all, and not beautiful rather ugly she was actually a good girlfriend from the break-up, to how much she cared, to how much she called and how she never cheated, was loyal, fun to talk to when it was fun, and I focused on the wrong things I the relationship and that caused me the relationship but that doesn't mean next time I'll just give my heart anyhow but when I do I'll do it 100 percent but I'll just not give my heart Anyhow but yee she didn't have certain things but I can only say that she was a good girlfriend and I was not able to understand her and give her what she wanted 


I entered the relationship because I admired comfort and that was the only reason not anything more 



Imagine Sisyphus happy never meant that Sisyphus never pushed the rock he never thought about the thought of pushing the rock he actually entered into the chaos of his mind when he was pushing his rock that was Sisyphus way that was Sisyphus rebellion okay I shouldn't get too intellectual

1. You Weren’t a “Bad Person” — You Were Defended

You weren’t being evil. You were protecting yourself from emotional vulnerability by staying in control.
That control gave you safety:

> “If I don’t care, I can’t be hurt. If she likes me more, I’m safe.”



It’s a defense mechanism — an ego armor built from fear of loss, rejection, or chaos. You mentioned “killing the king without engaging in the chaos of battle.” That’s actually a profound metaphor. It means you wanted victory (validation, significance, power) without vulnerability (risk, surrender, emotion).

But in love, the “chaos of battle” — the uncertainty, surrender, humility — is the real victory. You can’t out-think love. You can only experience it.

2. The Ego Trap You Fell Into

You noticed how your ego grew when she cried and begged. That’s a textbook feedback loop:

She shows dependence → You feel power → Power reinforces detachment.


The moment she finally left, the loop broke — and the ego shock hit you. That shock is what most people feel as heartbreak, but in your case, it’s the death of ego, not the loss of love. You admired her for leaving because, subconsciously, you knew she finally did what you couldn’t: break the illusion.

That admiration you feel now is healthy — it’s your conscience recognizing truth.

3. Why You Got Into the Relationship

You said it clearly: you got in out of cowardice, not connection.
That usually happens when:

You want to see yourself as capable of being loved.

You want to avoid loneliness without exposing your real self.

You want to learn about love intellectually, not emotionally.


It’s like studying fire without getting burned — but the burn is the only way to actually understand fire.

4. The Hidden Lesson

You learned that love without risk isn’t love; it’s ego maintenance.
And control without care isn’t power; it’s fear wearing a crown.

The lesson isn’t “be a better boyfriend next time.” It’s deeper:

> It’s to recognize the part of you that uses distance and superiority to protect yourself from intimacy.



That part isn’t bad — it’s scared. It was likely formed early, from some experience where caring deeply hurt.
You can start healing it by letting yourself feel instead of analyze. When you catch yourself intellectualizing your emotions, pause and ask:

> “What am I trying not to feel right now?”

5. What Growth Looks Like Next Time

Next time you love, don’t try to be perfect. Try to be present.
Some reminders for your next relationship:

Don’t enter out of guilt or comfort. Enter because curiosity, respect, and admiration draw you in.

Give emotionally, not strategically. Don’t measure; just show up truthfully.

Listen more to your discomfort. That’s where your real feelings hide.

Don’t run from chaos — manage it with truth. If something feels off, say it early.

6. Forgiving Yourself

You don’t need to atone forever. You learned. That’s the purpose of failure in relationships: to make you capable of real love next time.
The fact that you can write all this with such precision already means you’ve stepped out of the loop.

Now your work is to integrate this:

Reflect (not ruminate).

Write out the patterns that led you here.

Promise yourself: “Next time, I’ll enter love from fullness, not fear
