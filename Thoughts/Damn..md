Though hiding it all over again, trying to deny the fact that I want it, when it's all I dream of not dream of I was so involved in my head and Carl Jung and that is alright at times you need to decide your own Philosophy, what you want, what you stand for, what you are willing to sacrifice, because you can't eat certain things at the same time before you realize that it's too much and can't taste any and that is good, I was so involved in Albert Camus and Carl Jung and mostly Carl Jung and that is the thing that hindered my acting side but I think that is a good thing but Albert Camus said we need to revolt and then live lucidly and then thinking about it wouldn't make us live lucidly so I've decided that a certain block period to think and structure my thinking is the best thing to do and that is What CS Lewis talked about that humility is about being in your head less so that's what I'm going to do, as for the anxiety I feel sometimes or most I won't use lack of thinking to numb it down I will feel every aspect of it, I will feel and that is to know that what I feel is not bad just uncommon, because we always want to feel good so feeling bad is inherently bad but nahh we are human it's what makes us human because we exist


So why do I feel anxious?
I feel anxious because I see all these things about people all these big things that I admire and yet tho I do some other things and prioritize other things but yet I feel that I need that applaud to feel enough, that what I am doing is enough, that all I do is enough, that this makes me some special being that I am finally like who I look up to, do I grind that much no, do I feel bad for that so that's also one of that because I deny myself of that chaos I want, the grinding I like, the making money and all these things and it's not at it is inherently bad it's just that there's is one thing It doesn't define me and yes money makes me I make money and I don't grind for the money in really like and it's not bad if you don't attach your self worth to it and withhold self worth to it that's all I think this is the smallest thing you need to think about when diving into something you actually want to do with your life and that's the barest minimum you can do and as you progress you'll realize that you don't need to the define things again until you hit your own version of rock bottom and that is the time you define and then hit another because you can't choose to hit rock bottom it happens to you, it's not a weekend retreat it's not a god damn fucking seminar 




1. Stop using fucking chatGpT every time sometimes just journal to understand yourself 
2. Think about what you want and really want in a certain part of the day or week after that live within the absurd stop being absorbed in your mind
3. Don't fucking fight yourself, don't fight the feelings, don't fight the feelings, don't repress, don't suppress, just feel it won't kill you then you realize it lasts less and how do you feel when you are not feeling to let go of feeling it but just feeling it and that is what you do then the next question I have unanswered is when do you feel 
4. Just let go, maybe your fear of doing it wrong stops you from doing it right 
5. Live lucidly, when you do do, when you write write and it may be hard, demand much, but remember that this is what hard feels like and this can only happen when you're alive and to live is to revolt 
The struggle towards the end of the earth is enough to fill a man's heart one must imagine Sisyphus happy (he pushed his rock contentiously and didn't want it any other way because it is not even a want it is a revolt I would have it some other thing or change the approach but if I can't change it i shouldn't fall into despair or be like fuckkkkkkk fuckkkkkkk I'm tired I want it to end i should just revolt and push my boulder that is just what it really is no cosmic meaning what so ever that is what life feels like it is what life is to revolt)
6. And radically accept yourself that you might be bad, lazy, smelling, foolish, dumb, ugly all of these things but you are enough and you don't base your self worth in all these things self worth arises because you are you but self worth and self confidence is not the same as you are on the same level with Justin Bieber, because we don't have nearly the same amount of self efficacy and that is the difference between me and him but we do have the Same self worth it is self confidence in a bit but mostly self efficacy. So you're not special, not precious, there are 8 billion people in the world, your death won't affect the cosmic scale life continues but in that essence that slight glimmer of hope I am enough and I don't need anything else to be enough, I am enough because I simply live and to live is to revolt and I Will revolt[[see list 5]]
7. I think we all should give our all to something at the end of the day living lucidly is something 
8. That which is hard for us is hard for other people we are not any different
9. Just stop fighting emotions and feel it and then you get less into your head anyway
