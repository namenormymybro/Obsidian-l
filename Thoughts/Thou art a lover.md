What is self abandonment in the face of sacrifice

These are things I've been thinking about and it's like at what point do you prove your love or stop, at what point does trying to prove your love become self inflicting abandonment, if I give everything I have to make you happy did I just abandon myself to make you happy? If I'm supposed to be the most important person to me, why sacrifice for you? What is sacrifice? What is chivalry?
These are concepts that have baffled me for sometime and I keep thinking about something and it's like 
Maybe self abandonment is okay if the person appreciate and does it with you but is that iron sharpening iron or iron corroding ion, the corrosion of two iron, is that the healthy one
You sharpen a sword but you don't break the sword? 
If I change my values for me doesn't that mean you're important, what are certain things I should give up, what shouldn't I, because sacrifice is important, If I miss a day of work to attend your race or something does that mean I just abandoned my dreams for yours?
Will love say it is good for me to abandon my goals or negative self inflicting, if I didn't would that mean that love should understand that this is important to me too or should love be angry that love is not love? Is it about who cares for one more? Or about which one is rarer it grander
