Mehh I think want to write this I don't really know where to start let me just list a few things and that will be a wrap then this is the opposite of the title? Maybe not

1. What do I really want 
2. How I feel about myself or at least want to feel
3. What kind of person do I want to be personally is there a reason to this question what do I really choose in this in
4. How do I feel when certain scenerios happen 
5. What I don't want to give a fuvk about 
6. What I want to give a fuvk about 
7. How I want to pursue certain things 
8. Overview there's nothing else to add 
9. The mindset 
10. The absurd 



-  What do I really want:
      I want to be successful for sure but what is success to me anyway I think it's a lot more than a fancy car but all in all it's boiling down to worldly success in this section because that is not success if it's is not a Lambo and all it is a fufiled 
      - Get rich: how Rich? I don't know 
      - Have money: how much I don't know 
      - buy cars, mansions and all how much I don't know 
     What I do know is that I want money and a lot of it 
     But I do know some certain things : I want it young, black, legally and while doing something I can say that to the little extent of it I love it that it makes me feel alive if it doesn't I'll make myself feel alive through it but that's about it basically the Camus way, I want to write a book sometime in my life I don't know when but I will
     I do hope it's through crypto, finance, data I just want to know that no matter what I choose and why I choose what I choose it doesn't define me as a person if at all nobody sees it I will that doesn't mean because it doesn't define me as a person I will be contented or accept my broke predicaments it is just that myself Worth is not dependent on it and to be honest shouldn't be on such fleeting things tho important and very important still in a way fleeting 
 
  -  Second edition huge goose bumps:
     How i feel about myself:
     For someone that prides myself in how smart I am it is amazing how stupid I am at the same time 
     I pride myself in how much I know so I just read and read and read a bunch of information that to be honest has absolutely no relevance to me and that gives me the illusion of progress for no absolutely no reason even though there's no destination so I think I need to actually structure my life more 

>      When ignored not in that sense just in the sense of ohh people invite each other to parties but not me first of all I don't even fucking like those parties mehn I just like the idea of it that's for sure and the issue is one thing I just wanted to feel useful in that sense that invite me too so I just know how much of an attention seeker I was and I thought that if I had value people should see it and people should know what is valuable I wasn't more wrong and even if people don't see it I'm still valuable because I see it and I'm not going to say valuable doesn't matter kind of intellectual discussion cause no
