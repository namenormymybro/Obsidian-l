Qualities 
- Responsibility: Response + ability 
  The ability to take her actions and not be reactive about it, not to burst shout or something just dey jeje I've been learning this, make her responsible too point out her wrongs 
- learn about her learn what makes her tick, what she likes, what she dislikes, appeal to that more, learn everything about her 
  But don't deny your feelings too, you matter, she matters too, both of you need to know that
- Give her as much attention as she wants and when I can't explain or well people want different amounts of attention given, for a girl who would do anything for you, do anything for her too
- Show your fucking boundaries make everybody get sense, overlook sometimes but not too much, remember we are all net positives
- Be okay being without her
- she's not bigger than you, always know that
