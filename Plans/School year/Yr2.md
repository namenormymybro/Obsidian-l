This is a good time of the year as you now have a stable GP, a good Starting point if played right and all in all you are good to go

Focus:
- The plan on the money will be harder cause of it's best to strike with freshers that could be done with assignments, test or something other as per this is a side hustle 

- The plan has been laid up so the best is building on it 

- The incorporation of learning new skills and socializing will be harder than ever eg Selling, Programming and Writing
