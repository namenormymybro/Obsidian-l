”Moreover, I, on my side, require of every writer, first or last, a simple and sincere account of his own life,
and not merely what he has heard of other men’s lives”
He said that people should live their lives and write about it, he was talking to writers and that they shouldn't write about stories that they haven't lived

"Most men, even in this comparatively free country, through mere ignorance and mistake, are so occupied with the factitious cares and superfluously coarse labors of life that its finer fruits cannot be plucked by them."
In short people care about the wrong things

“the laboring man has not leisure for a true integrity day by day; he cannot afford to sustain the manliest relations to men; his labor would be depreciated in the market. He has no time to be any thing but a machine.”
He was against, enslavement of labor, he was against too much of labor and was against the fact of always working due to the fact that he cannot prove himself with integrity, that at the end of the day he cannot build himself, he cannot build himself with character nor virtue and all he knows is just the grind and the toil, he has no time to be anything but a machine, he works and works but he is not anything more
Theorau was against struggle that chooses you, the fact that some people inherit farm lands, and inherit the struggle of those before them, for they cannot choose what to struggle for but the struggle chooses them and they constantly toil
He scorned on the fact of over working and hoarding of wealth and money and the fact that most of over working and working and comes at the virtue of life itself 
He lived in periods in which slavery was rampant and that he hated the idea of slavery and the fact of using methods that are immoral all to gain money and he valued internal integrity more than anything external 

Public opinion is a weak tyrant compared with our own private opinion. What a man thinks of himself, that it is which determines, or rather indicates, his fate

One thing to put to mind is the part that thoreau valued internal integrity a lot and internal truth a whole lot than anything else, which the scorns the fact if having to do immoral things for money or having to slave away for money and in the fact that you are actually free, you are not actually free, you are a slave to yourself that 

“Think,
also, of the ladies of the land weaving toilet cushions against the last day, not to betray too green an interest in their fates! As if you could kill time without injuring eternity.”
He is against the fact that people do busy work because that they do want to appear productive or busy that we should do concious work because we do actually acre about the work that we do 
Can you injure time without killing eternity, the sole fact that you can't waste time and any time wasted affects your life even if you do waste in in the present 


“"The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation. What is called resignation is confirmed desperation. From the desperate city you go into the desperate country, and have to console yourself with the bravery of minks and muskrats. A stereotyped but unconscious despair is concealed even under what are called the games and amusements of mankind. There is no play in them, for this comes after work. But it is a characteristic of wisdom not to do desperate things.”
The mass of men live lives of quiet desperation.
He said that everyone is desperate, no one actually does what they want to do, they follow a certain pattern and a role in order to fit into society 
Most of what we call games are not real fun, that we do most of what we call games to distract ourselves from work and moreso to distract ourselves from ourselves, that we do not find real fun in what we actually call games 
It is wisdom to not to desperate things, This is the fact that wisdom comes to those truly living their purpose and not following the preconceived ideals of society, but more so wisdom doesn't come to those who do that, wisdom is them

“what are the true necessaries and means of life,
it appears as if men had deliberately chosen the common mode of living because they preferred it to any other. Yet they honestly think there is no choice left. But alert and healthy natures remember that the sun rose clear. It is never too late to give up our prejudices. No way of thinking or doing, however ancient, can be trusted without proof. What every body echoes or in silence passes by as true to-day may turn out to be falsehood to-morrow, mere smoke of opinion, which some had trusted for a cloud that would sprinkle fertilizing rain on their fields.”

“Age is no better, hardly so well, qualified for an instructor as youth,
for it has not profited so much as it has lost. One may almost doubt if the wisest man has learned any thing of absolute value by living.” - the old hardly know any better than the young about living, that they wasn't any wisdom gained whether by living young or short about how to live and most people still follow the status quo and do things they don't even like

“Some things are really necessaries of life in some circles, the most helpless and diseased, which in others are luxuries merely, and in others still are entirely unknown.”
Some things are necessities of life in some circles and not in some others further referring to the idea of that people say you can't get stronger bones without meat but the oxen who eats meat pulls them in their farmland and that certain necessities are made up by society and also we tend to attract so called necessities from other groups without even ever critiquing it
