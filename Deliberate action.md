I went into the woods because I choose to live deliberately, to suck out the essentials of life, to see if I couldn't learn what if it could teach and not, so that when I would die discover that I had not lived 
HENRY DAVID THEOREAU WALFEN

This is a brilliant line
That got me thinking 
What are the essentials of life
Did Thoreau know what the essentials of life where 
If he discovered, how would he know that these are they
How could he learn
If he didn't know how did he learn
What was he doing when he was learning 
What were his experiences
Did he have a traumatic moment that revealed it to him
