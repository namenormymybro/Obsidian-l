What is the purpose of learning if we don't use it? 
Then was the information useless 
Yes it was but not in the case you'd expect 
If I learn all about crypto and I don't trade does it mean it was useless yet it does but in some sense if it changed my outlook on things then it was useful 

The practicality of an information is not the same as the usefulness of it
But it is the same 
Practical information is always considered useful but useful may not be practical
And in some sense if I learn how a syntax of a language works but I never really use that part when I'm using the language was it useless yes but only if it never changed my outlook or made me understand something better 
But in a sense this doesn't quite resonate with previous examples mainly because usefulness on practical fields don't go hand in hand and usefulness of an information can't really be explained using a field that only aims at something and to do that is stupidity 

If I learn programming to become a better problem solver that works but at the same time what I've done doesn't match the time Investments and I could be better off doing something else but If I learnt it yo build an app and I became a better problem solver then have I truly won if I feel so 


But in a sense I would say as David goggins said
“THE PURPOSE IS YOU” In all we do we are the purpose and if you have something to do, you should do or shouldn't the best thing is about being the purpose 
Because in hindsight 
The purpose is not building a dashboard 
But becoming a person who can build a dashboard 
Then you build the dashboard 

You eventually come to the same conclusion in the end but that doesn't mean it wasn't worth it 

We all die in the end so, are you saying all we did was for naught, I doubt so, if at all there isn't any grand meaning, nobody to cheer us on, welcome us, but if at all the purpose was us to make us a better person, more skilled, ambitious, smarter or anything at all then that is a win

This is not to say that the usefulness of an information is useless if having no practicality, but I think practicality is more important?


Then if I wanted to learn to build a legit app but It flopped did I win or did I lose
One could say that the fact I that maybe later on I learnt about how to actually build one that didn't flop I won that by changing the goal I change whether I won or lost but that is a lie, if we all change certain things and we say I lost but I loved it then I actually won and I didn't care about the other part, NO that Is just a coping mechanism and that is bad
You failed doesn't mean you didn't profit from a failure you failed and sometimes our failures give us more than it takes and we wouldn't want it any other way but it is still failure 
Not every bad thing happens for a reason and we are always supposed to be stuck in a good default mode network all the time, the bad things are actually just good because it is happening for a reason and you will smile and scratch your ass and everything would have been worth it yes we hope so but stop trying to bring a positive light into everything, some bad things just happens, some are tests but doesn't mean that me passing it I get rewarded it was simply just a test or character or due diligence or preservance or discipline or dignity, that is all
