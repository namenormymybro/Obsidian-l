As Robert Greene said in his book mastery the most important thing in mastery is not specifically how luxurious the certain field or specialization seems, your parents controlling you to do a certain thing or the market value of that certain Skill or vocation at that particular time but your life's purpose and knowing that is the first step to mastery. Some people find it out early, some after trial and error or specialization but the whole process of it is to find it and figure it out and when you do you will know because it will strike you and hit you like a light bulb, as something profound transcending what you have prior experienced and this will be the best thing you have ever experienced.

Do not over specialize and only keep to one particular path but generalize along your path, add certain skills together, make them link up in a way that no other person can do and that will grant you an edge and a supreme one over many others and that will be the guiding light and the most important thing you will not only do in your mastery process but in your life

**The plan that Isaiah has for mastery:**

Earlier on I have always loved tech in general, then while reading books I have loved a certain amount of psychology and the likes, plus a certain amount of business and also coming into the coding in general I have also learnt to like things like design psychology and aesthetics( Front end development) but not as much as graphic design or art and also not really like copywriting for the web or copywriting as it involves with sales but because I will have to do it or learn it to be quite successful in the whole process of website development, while still liking something like poems just because of the sophistication and stories because of the world play in them, the creativity and also the extreme art of something that you know it took the writer a long time to do it but not the art of fully dwelling in it. Doing economics last semester I think it made me love it because it brought the business love of me and also the love of psychology and human nature I haven't genuinely too liked on it's own but i think everything seems okay together but I still don't know enough to deal with it or know this is the path set but I think I have a path for myself right now but not a clear nor specific one or at least not paths but love for certain things………. As always we learn everyday and you cannot be who you are without learning who you are but here it goes

- Tech (Full stack(with python) and data science (Provides a certain leverage in quant finance, fiance(), economics() and certain things))

- Business know how 

- Psychology to know about the human mind and how people think, why people do what they do, interpersonal relationships

- Philosophy/ History, because you can't predict the future without knowing the past and also the thought process of people before you, certain philosophies, certain school of thought( Economics, History, Philosophy and the rest eg(Socrates, Karl Marx, Aristotle, Alexander the great, Aristotle, Plato and certain things relating))…… not only for knowing but for also a certain sophistication to your words and thinking
