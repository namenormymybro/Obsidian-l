Everyday you haven't achieved your goals or dreams you,  it's another day you prove the doubters right 

I've all thought this is a stupid statement, like what do you have to prove but it's not about self worth
Self worth is inherent we have worth because we have it, it's about self efficacy, it is the answer to the question is that, are we even worth anything? Do we deserve another chance of life, do we deserve to wake up each day

Self efficacy is the part that, what you can do and achieve and accomplish and, what you have accomplished, what skills you have and how valuable you are in a certain scenerio

So in any case no one is ever judging your worth but rather your efficacy 
No one should ever tell you if you are worth anything, no one should ever tell you if you're supposed to have another chance at life or live another day,that is not up to anyone except through you 
So the doubters never doubt your worth or you but whether you can accomplish it 
Life is not promised so the outcomes too
So your worth is never dedicated at who you are nor even who you are becoming but about being about lucid living, I know this doesn't really soften the blow, but it's just about you don't have anything to prove about whether you're worth something or validation but about what you can contribute 

This is why:

a surgeon may be extremely valuable in a hospital

but nearly useless in a tech startup

while a programmer is the reverse

and a philosopher may be useless in both

yet all have equal inherent worth


Worth ≠ utility.
Utility ≠ worth.


So Still prove the doubters wrong not because you seek validation but because you want to show them that you can do it, that you can get what you want 

The last of human freedoms is choice
And that you have chose to do something, so you must choose to see it through 
The choice to wake up each day also comes through it to live through it and sleep back through it again, not to be dreaded though but not to be praised, but the sky is blue and pretty though it really is, I'm not trying to fake optimism same as everything, nah most at max
