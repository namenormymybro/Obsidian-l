The goal for 2026 is intentionality as well as sponteinity 

‘Dont be a destructive cynist, so afraid to not lose so you don't play, congratulations you don't lose but you also don't win either’

In everything be intentional, but not to the point where there's lack of sponteinity
Be intentional with your sponteinity 
Which is why I bought that journal To plan my time well and plan my actions 
If you craft time to read that is intentionality, but no one knows where your mind could venture of to as you are reading and you might think of something profound or have a realization in which case is spontaneous 

The books I will be reading next year 
How I want to structure it is that I read 2 books a month and I actually calm down to actually finish a book which amounts to 24 books next year 
Just 20 pages a day multiplied by 14 days is 280 pages most books are less

The fEthe thing I do not like is the organization of something else but for something to exist there must be structure for it to exist and take good Shape therefore sponteinity is not the death of intentionality nor is intentionality the death of sponteinity. Intentionality can be used to shape sponteinity to a certain field so that it ensures more of depth than of breath, you do fewer things but you are unhinged in the fewer things 

The thing that you are doing right now is the only thing you have, you don't have next day or next week you only have right now and what you want or what you have to do right now is the only thing you can and should do
Which is why I decided to have and keep a journal preferably a bullet journal
