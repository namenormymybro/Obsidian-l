Funny how I crave the freedom to do anything I want but when I get that freedom I don't do anything or at least anything worth the while and I want to do something worth the while so I crave structure and boom

Realized that both aren't mutually exclusive, you can crave structure and still crave

This is also a question in morality one cannot function in society without a certain code of morals to abide to and to abide by at the same time, too much of infringement on morals might eventually cause you to make morally good but net bad decisions 

So the best thing is to identify the end
Then know what pushes the needle to that end so you form structure around that, so that in the Grand scheme of things you don't waver

For instance the journaling I wanted to start that shows a lot of activities I want to do daily and then shows whether I did them or not them in another page I explain how I did that is the daily log eg in the dashboard looking think I can tick I coded today then in the description of the daily logs I can say, it was python and I did this and this nothing more
Any other book to understand what I'm doing is separate from it 
The book will contain certain plans I'm thinking about just in a bullet list or typed

Let's structure it this way 
- **Journal** (will cop)
- **Individual** **book** 
- **Planning** **book** (Obsidian)
Okay assuming I read real analysis and coded today in the **journal** I will tick studied in the dashboard place and write down what I studied in the daily log, in the actual **individual** **book** is where I actually study and jot down all my notes, it is in the **planning** **book** I will then have to write what I think I should do and how to go about it, to plan my next ideas, but I will also then write certain ideas I am now confident I want to add in the journal, or the planning book could just be obsidian and no need for it but it is a book I have and used for such. Obviously the individual planning goes in the individual book for example if you want to read something on real analysis it must go in the book dedicated to real analysis, don't confuse, just have a journal anything you want to plan should be in obsidian and any book you are using to read use it to plan what you want to read 

This will also help me to trust the process, at least even if I'm not getting a grand thing in as long as I'm doing what I'm supposed to do and I can visually see that I am putting in the work that is the only thing I need to chase
