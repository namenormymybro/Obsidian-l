It's all about what I decide as fun, watching anime a movie, reading a book maybe fun, listening to music, watching YouTube is fun
Coding, x, programming, reading is fun too, thought it requires a vast amount of dedication is fun too 
Albert Camus says not to expect life to be a certain way and that is it
Do both types of fun in a day
Most days can be the second type of fun
Some days are the first type of fun 
It is still fun
Just about net positives
Life is a new positive
It is not about choosing one or the other, it is about how to choose one and the other and when to choose one and the other 
You may choose not to watch anime but read a book, that is fun, that is it's type of fun 
Everything is fun, in the sense that we are here, we are alive, we can do it 
Don't expect life to be a certain way but don't be too rigid either not too flexible and all this comes in vivid light when I structure my time and my life and decide what I should do and what matters to me 
The first is fun because we live 
The second is fun because we live
Sure I'm not going to act like it is hard blah blah blah, it is simple, it is hard but sometime hard is fun, sometimes it is hard, sometimes fun is boring but we are all grateful in order to be here if I could say so
It is hard this is what hard feels like - Alex hormozi
