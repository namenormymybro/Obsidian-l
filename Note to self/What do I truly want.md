The vivid emotions….

The actual feeling that you can do anything stand on the world stage, play golf, eat anything, go anywhere and not be bothered by a fallacy that in someway limits you…. Become a runner, make music, create the most emotional videos, make films that strike the heart as one of Shakespeare poems and the vibe of your name and if need be create your own genre do so, become the second coming of Beethoven or the second coming of anyone feel like you are worthy of something feel that you are actually valued and not putting yourself inside that cage you call home and you can do more not feel down and conform and whatever I might be saying in hindsight might not make sense but I will say it any other way but the only way to beat some certain things is to know who you are or want to be and be unapologetically that and not care about anything really
