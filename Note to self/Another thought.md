Go first…. Don't wait for someone to realize something or for a girl to text first or something else….. I'd you need a girl, go first to speak to her….. if you need to go somewhere go first..i need to build that confidence in myself to trust myself to not be afraid of anything and everything that I come through and I my ideals and my beliefs…..if you want something and need something go first and like what Simon sinek said people focus not on what they want but on the obstacles along the way so the best thing is to say fuck it I will do it either way and not to overthink everything and anything and focus only on what you want
