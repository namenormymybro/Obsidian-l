Why just why are you so afraid of making a mistake seen in some light, feeling dumb or that you should have known better or more than you do feel like you should be held in a certain standard in people's heads and people's minds that when you do that you have disappointed them and that is the big deal… not even in how they see you but in how you see yourself and how you feel you should be seen and this creates the pressure not to fail that you actually still fail and get into the light you didn't want to in the first place…. To be honest you don't owe anybody how you should be seen, the reason of you doing your life how you should and stand on certain things you don't have a ground and people's words, talks and actions can easily pulverize you and make you change and there is a pressure to maintain an image even though you aren't especially in new people you shouldn't and stand firm on it say no… someone's words shouldn't change your decision that easily……..


The whole getting mathematics has taught me certain things….
1.  The whole not having a ground…. It all started with mummy at home you have been researching something and been checking about it and trying to make it make sense even just a little bit or any at all and mummy's words just came and altered your decision making progress and you started doubting yourself….. fast forward to aje…. The words of Ralph who doesn't know anything about things in general and all that made you second guess your decision and all and that's good take criticisms from any angle but don't change what you don't want to because of it….

Even though I have heard Alex hormozi talk about this a lot of times why does this seem to make sense now I think it's the whole relationship with learning 
I think learning occurs in three ways 
1.  School way in general la cram la pour very little application 

2. Skills: you learn and apply see what changed and what you can do better and why what happened to make it work and dissect it only then can the patterns come for true mastery to relate it with one another like Robert Greene said 

3. Character or mindset change: A feeling to how it relates to you and how you've been in the red and not known about it all these time and having to relate 
- Why was this running me before 
- What area did this affect me
- How does this change it
- With this is the other scenarios what would I have done differently
