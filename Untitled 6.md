There is 
Intelligence 
Knowledge 
Information 

The vast amount of information present doesn't mean one is knowledgeable, information is not a test of knowledge, for one to be knowledgeable about a field one must be able to have much of information and the information must also be congruent enough to use or apply the information or the information must be practical enough to be used, or at least to be able to construct constructive ideas that at least help build clarity, deepen understanding or something or take us further to the truth in which we find 
This is not a definition for practical information but also for useful information 

Useful information maybe not be practical but practical information is useful information and the practicality of the information is not a measure of the usefulness of the information 
As sometimes entertainment maybe the sole use of the information 

Then intelligence 
Then true Measure of intelligence is self autonomy
The ability to know yourself and understand yourself and know your limits and understand your tickers such that you have confidence in your knowledge of yourself but also build around it and craft around it 
As humans I'd say that we are predetermined for we learn from what is around us whether we really want to or not for that basic reason we are most the byproduct of our environment taking into account our formative years after we have crafted ourselves and taken pride in ourselves we are less a byproduct of environment but of choice 

So then knowledge is also not a metric of intelligence as information is not a metric of knowledge 

Then for real knowledge to not only be based on information but ti actually fufiled it's purpose as intentionality not only must it be congruent it must be coherent
Congruence is the ability of a belief to be true because it is bounded in reality,  eg the grass is green is true because we can see that the grass is actually green because it is congruent 
Coherence is that it must follow a logical thinking structure or must have a structure so that when added up must equal to a coherent idea in the sense that the idea must make sense and could be used for something but if it's not a practical information it must equal to a coherent justifiable idea

Practical information must be coherent and congruent 
Because not only must you know html to build a website you need to know that a p tag and a body tag and all that exists and must be coherent in the sense that you know how and when to use them

But useful information which is not practical must be coherent in as much as it is not congruent because at least it helps give a structured Idea which can change it challenge our beliefs or at least help us see something from a different point of view
