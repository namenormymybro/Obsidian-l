1. How do you know what you know

How do you know what you know:
To learn is to justify what you know?
So how do we get what to have any beliefs then try to justify it?

Three ways people approach the concept of truth 
1. Correspondence 
2. Coherence 
3. Concensous or pragmatism 

Correspondence is absolutism eg I am a boy, this is a girl, this table is made of wood, we can be secure in our truth claims when the claim we make is the same as the reality which is albeit irrespective of us

But In a sense truth mush cohere and must be part of a system and then we go to the things we consider truth based on what we believe true

Pragmatism is what we decide is true is what works 
This means that then truth is the one that is lived 
Things are true if it helps us solve problems this then means that this is not about reality because that is correspondence but in a sense it is more about truth is the one that we as a society has come together in order to decide as true but less about whether true or not
